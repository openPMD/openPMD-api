Construct a new Series. Parameters:

* filepath: The file path.
* at: Access mode.
* options: Advanced backend configuration via JSON.
    May be specified as a JSON-formatted string directly, or as a path
    to a JSON textfile, prepended by an at sign '@'.

For details on access modes, JSON/TOML configuration and iteration encoding,
refer to:

* https://openpmd-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/workflow.html#access-modes
* https://openpmd-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/details/backendconfig.html
* https://openpmd-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/concepts.html#iteration-and-series

In case of file-based iteration encoding, the file names for each
iteration are determined by an expansion pattern that must be specified.
It takes one out of two possible forms:

1. Simple form: %T is replaced with the iteration index, e.g.
   `simData_%T.bp` becomes `simData_50.bp`.
2. Padded form: e.g. %06T is replaced with the iteration index padded to
   at least six digits. `simData_%06T.bp` becomes `simData_000050.bp`.

The backend is determined:

1. Explicitly via the JSON/TOML parameter `backend`, e.g. `{"backend":
   "adios2"}`.
2. Otherwise implicitly from the filename extension, e.g.
   `simData_%T.h5`.

The filename extension can be replaced with a globbing pattern %E.
It will be replaced with an automatically determined file name extension:

1. In CREATE mode: The extension is set to a backend-specific default
   extension. This requires that the backend is specified via JSON/TOML.
2. In READ_ONLY, READ_WRITE and READ_LINEAR modes: These modes require
   that files already exist on disk. The disk will be scanned for files
   that match the pattern and the resulting file extension will be used.
   If the result is ambiguous or no such file is found, an error is
   raised.
3. In APPEND mode: Like (2.), except if no matching file is found. In
   that case, the procedure of (1.) is used, owing to the fact that
   APPEND mode can be used to create new datasets.

Merge two JSON/TOML datasets into one.

Merging rules:
1. If both `defaultValue` and `overwrite` are JSON/TOML objects, then the
resulting JSON/TOML object will contain the union of both objects'
keys. If a key is specified in both objects, the values corresponding
to the key are merged recursively. Keys that point to a null value
after this procedure will be pruned.
2. In any other case, the JSON/TOML dataset `defaultValue` is replaced in
its entirety with the JSON/TOML dataset `overwrite`.

Note that item 2 means that datasets of different type will replace each
other without error.
It also means that array types will replace each other without any notion
of appending or merging.

Possible use case:
An application uses openPMD-api and wants to do the following:
1. Set some default backend options as JSON/TOML parameters.
2. Let its users specify custom backend options additionally.

By using the json::merge() function, this application can then allow
users to overwrite default options, while keeping any other ones.

Parameters:
* default_value: A string containing either a JSON or a TOML dataset.
                 If the string begins with an `@`, the JSON/TOML dataset will be
                 read from the filesystem at the specified path.
                 An MPI communicator can be passed to read in parallel.
* overwrite:     A string containing either a JSON or TOML dataset (does
                 not need to be the same as `defaultValue`).
                 If the string begins with an `@`, the JSON/TOML dataset will be
                 read from the filesystem at the specified path.
                 An MPI communicator can be passed to read in parallel.
* returns:       The merged dataset, according to the above rules.
                 If `overwrite` was a JSON dataset, then as a JSON string,
                 otherwise as a TOML string.

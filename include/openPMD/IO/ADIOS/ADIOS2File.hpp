     * if NoStream. The rationale behind this is that parsing a Series
     * works differently for file-based and for stream-based engines:
     * * stream-based: Iterations are parsed as they arrive. For parsing an
     *   iteration, the iteration must be awaited.
     *   ADIOS2File::requireActiveStep takes care of this.
     * * file-based: The Series is parsed up front. If no step has been
     *   opened yet, ADIOS2 gives access to all variables and attributes
     *   from all steps. Upon opening a step, only the variables from that
     *   step are shown which hinders parsing. So, until a step is
     *   explicitly opened via ADIOS2IOHandlerImpl::advance, do not open
     *   one.
     *   This is to enable use of ADIOS files without the Streaming API
     *   (i.e. all iterations should be visible to the user upon opening
     *   the Series.)
     *   @todo Add a workflow without up-front parsing of all iterations
     *         for file-based engines.

     *         API still works with files as intended.)

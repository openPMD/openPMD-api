     * Open Series as read-only, fails if Series is not found.
     * When to use READ_ONLY or READ_LINEAR:
     *
     * * When intending to use Series::readIterations()
     *   (i.e. step-by-step reading of iterations, e.g. in streaming),
     *   then Access::READ_LINEAR is preferred and always supported.
     *   Data is parsed inside Series::readIterations(), no data is available
     *   right after opening the Series.
     * * Otherwise (i.e. for random-access workflows), Access::READ_ONLY
     *   is required, but works only in backends that support random access.
     *   Data is parsed and available right after opening the Series.
     *
     * In both modes, parsing of iterations can be deferred with the JSON/TOML
     * option `defer_iteration_parsing`.
     *
     * Detailed rules:
     *
     * 1. In backends that have no notion of IO steps (all except ADIOS2),
     *    Access::READ_ONLY can always be used.
     * 2. In backends that can be accessed either in random-access or
     *    step-by-step, the chosen access mode decides which approach is used.
     *    Examples are the BP4 and BP5 engines of ADIOS2.
     * 3. In streaming backends, random-access is not possible.
     *    When using such a backend, the access mode will be coerced
     *    automatically to Access::READ_LINEAR. Use of Series::readIterations()
     *    is mandatory for access.
     * 4. Reading a variable-based Series is only fully supported with
     *    Access::READ_LINEAR.
     *    If using Access::READ_ONLY, the dataset will be considered to only
     *    have one single step.
     *    If the dataset only has one single step, this is guaranteed to work
     *    as expected. Otherwise, it is undefined which step's data is returned.

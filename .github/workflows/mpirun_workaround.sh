# mpiexec currently seems to have a bug where it tries to parse parameters
# of the launched application when they start with a dash, e.g.
# `mpiexec python ./openpmd-pipe --infile in.bp --outfile out.bp`
# leads to:
# >  An unrecognized option was included on the mpiexec command line:
# >
# >    Option: --infile
# >
# >  Please use the "mpiexec --help" command to obtain a list of all
# >  supported options.
#
# This script provides a workaround by putting the called sub-command into
# a script in a temporary file.

openPMD C++ & Python API
------------------------

openPMD is an open meta-data schema that provides meaning and self-description for data sets in science and engineering.
See `the openPMD standard <https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-standard>`_ for details of this schema.

This library provides a reference API for openPMD data handling.
Since openPMD is a schema (or markup) on top of portable, hierarchical file formats, this library implements various backends such as HDF5, ADIOS1, ADIOS2 and JSON.
Writing & reading through those backends and their associated files is supported for serial and `MPI-parallel <https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/>`_ workflows.

     * @brief Merge two JSON/TOML datasets into one.
     *
     * Merging rules:
     * 1. If both `defaultValue` and `overwrite` are JSON/TOML objects, then the
     *    resulting JSON/TOML object will contain the union of both objects'
     *    keys. If a key is specified in both objects, the values corresponding
     *    to the key are merged recursively. Keys that point to a null value
     *    after this procedure will be pruned.
     * 2. In any other case, the JSON/TOML dataset `defaultValue` is replaced in
     *    its entirety with the JSON/TOML dataset `overwrite`.
     *
     * Note that item 2 means that datasets of different type will replace each
     * other without error.
     * It also means that array types will replace each other without any notion
     * of appending or merging.
     *
     * Possible use case:
     * An application uses openPMD-api and wants to do the following:
     * 1. Set some default backend options as JSON/TOML parameters.
     * 2. Let its users specify custom backend options additionally.
     *
     * By using the json::merge() function, this application can then allow
     * users to overwrite default options, while keeping any other ones.
     *
     * @param defaultValue A string containing either a JSON or a TOML dataset.
     *        If the string begins with an `@`, the JSON/TOML dataset will be
     *        read from the filesystem at the specified path.
     * @param overwrite A string containing either a JSON or TOML dataset (does
     *        not need to be the same as `defaultValue`).
     *        If the string begins with an `@`, the JSON/TOML dataset will be
     *        read from the filesystem at the specified path.
     * @return std::string The merged dataset, according to the above rules. If
     *        `overwrite` was a JSON dataset, then as a JSON string, otherwise
     *        as a TOML string.

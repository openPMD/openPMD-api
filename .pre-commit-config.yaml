    # Unfortunately, the c++ option does not recognize .tpp files, so we need to do this manually
    # Since file filters in pre-commit work by logical AND, it's only possible to narrow the filter definition
    # So, we add a regex for the type of file that we want and additionally disable the 'types_or'
    # option entirely.

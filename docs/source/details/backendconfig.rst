.. _backendconfig:

JSON configuration
==================

While the openPMD API intends to be a backend-*independent* implementation of the openPMD standard, it is sometimes useful to pass configuration parameters to the specific backend in use.
:ref:`For each backend <backends-overview>`, configuration options can be passed via a JSON-formatted string or via environment variables.
A JSON option always takes precedence over an environment variable.

The fundamental structure of this JSON configuration string is given as follows:

.. literalinclude:: config_layout.json
   :language: json

This structure allows keeping one configuration string for several backends at once, with the concrete backend configuration being chosen upon choosing the backend itself.

The configuration is read in a case-sensitive manner.
Generally, keys of the configuration are *lower case*.
Parameters that are directly passed through to an external library and not interpreted within openPMD API (e.g. ``adios2.engine.parameters``) are unaffected by this and follow the respective library's conventions.

The configuration string may refer to the complete ``openPMD::Series`` or may additionally be specified per ``openPMD::Dataset``, passed in the respective constructors.
This reflects the fact that certain backend-specific parameters may refer to the whole Series (such as storage engines and their parameters) and others refer to actual datasets (such as compression).

A JSON configuration may either be specified as a regular string that can be parsed as a JSON object, or in the constructor of ``openPMD::Series`` alternatively as a path to a JSON-formatted text file.
In the latter case, the file path must be prepended by an at-sign ``@``.

For a consistent user interface, backends shall follow the following rules:

* The configuration structures for the Series and for each dataset should be defined equivalently.
* Any setting referring to single datasets should also be applicable globally, affecting all datasets.
* If a setting is defined globally, but also for a concrete dataset, the dataset-specific setting should override the global one.
* If a setting is passed to a dataset that only makes sense globally (such as the storage engine), the setting should be ignored except for printing a warning.
  Backends should define clearly which keys are applicable to datasets and which are not.


Backend-independent JSON configuration
--------------------------------------

The key ``defer_iteration_parsing`` can be used to optimize the process of opening an openPMD Series.
By default, a Series is parsed eagerly, i.e. opening a Series implies reading all available iterations.
Especially when a Series has many iterations, this can be a costly operation and users may wish to defer parsing of iterations to a later point adding ``{"defer_iteration_parsing": true}`` to their JSON configuration.

When parsing non-eagerly, each iteration needs to be explicitly opened with ``Iteration::open()`` before accessing.
(Notice that ``Iteration::open()`` is generally recommended to be used in parallel contexts to avoid parallel file accessing hazards).
Using the Streaming API (i.e. ``SeriesImpl::readIteration()``) will do this automatically.
Parsing eagerly might be very expensive for a Series with many iterations, but will avoid bugs by forgotten calls to ``Iteration::open()``.
In complex environments, calling ``Iteration::open()`` on an already open environment does no harm (and does not incur additional runtime cost for additional ``open()`` calls).

The key ``resizable`` can be passed to ``Dataset`` options.
It if set to ``{"resizable": true}``, this declares that it shall be allowed to increased the ``Extent`` of a ``Dataset`` via ``resetDataset()`` at a later time, i.e., after it has been first declared (and potentially written).
For HDF5, resizable Datasets come with a performance penalty.
For JSON and ADIOS2, all datasets are resizable, independent of this option.

Configuration Structure per Backend
-----------------------------------

.. _backendconfig-adios2:

ADIOS2
^^^^^^

A full configuration of the ADIOS2 backend:

.. literalinclude:: adios2.json
   :language: json

All keys found under ``adios2.dataset`` are applicable globally as well as per dataset, keys found under ``adios2.engine`` only globally.
Explanation of the single keys:

* ``adios2.engine.type``: A string that is passed directly to ``adios2::IO:::SetEngine`` for choosing the ADIOS2 engine to be used.
  Please refer to the `official ADIOS2 documentation <https://adios2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engines/engines.html>`_ for a list of available engines.
* ``adios2.engine.parameters``: An associative array of string-formatted engine parameters, passed directly through to ``adios2::IO::SetParameters``.
  Please refer to the official ADIOS2 documentation for the allowable engine parameters.
* ``adios2.engine.usesteps``: Described more closely in the documentation for the :ref:`ADIOS2 backend<backends-adios2>`.
* ``adios2.dataset.operators``: This key contains a list of ADIOS2 `operators <https://adios2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components/components.html#operator>`_, used to enable compression or dataset transformations.
  Each object in the list has two keys:

  * ``type`` supported ADIOS operator type, e.g. zfp, sz
  * ``parameters`` is an associative map of string parameters for the operator (e.g. compression levels)

Any setting specified under ``adios2.dataset`` is applicable globally as well as on a per-dataset level.
Any setting under ``adios2.engine`` is applicable globally only.

.. _backendconfig-hdf5:

HDF5
^^^^

A full configuration of the HDF5 backend:

.. literalinclude:: hdf5.json
   :language: json

All keys found under ``hdf5.dataset`` are applicable globally (future: as well as per dataset).
Explanation of the single keys:

* ``adios2.dataset.chunks``: This key contains options for data chunking via `H5Pset_chunk <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/H5P/H5Pset_chunk.htm>`__.
  The default is ``"auto"`` for a heuristic.
  ``"none"`` can be used to disable chunking.
  Chunking generally improves performance and only needs to be disabled in corner-cases, e.g. when heavily relying on independent, parallel I/O that non-collectively declares data records.


Other backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do currently not read the configuration string.
Please refer to the respective backends' documentations for further information on their configuration.

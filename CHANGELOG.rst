0.15.0
------
**Date:** 2023-03-25

C++17, Error Recovery, ADIOS2 BP5, Append & Read-Linear Modes, Performance & Memory

This release adds error recovery mechanisms, in order to access erroneous datasets, created e.g. by crashing simulations.
The BP5 engine of ADIOS2 v2.9 is fully supported by this release, including access to its various features for more fine-grained control of memory usage.
Various I/O performance improvements for HDF5 are activated by default.
Runtime configuration of openPMD and its backends, e.g. selection of backends and compression, is now consistently done via JSON, and alternatively via TOML for better readability.
The data storage/retrieval API now consistently supports all common C++ pointer types (raw and smart pointers), implementing automatic memory optimizations for ADIOS2 BP5 if using unique pointers.

The miminum required C++ version is now C++17.
Supported Python versions are Python 3.10 and 3.11.

Streaming Support, Python, Benchmarks

This release adds first support for streaming I/O via ADIOS2's SST engine.
More I/O benchmarks have been added with realistic application load patterns.
Many Python properties for openPMD attributes have been modernized, with slight breaking changes in Iteration and Mesh data order.
This release requires C++14 and adds support for Python 3.9.
With this release, we leave the "alpha" phase of the software and declare "beta" status.

Refined fileBased Series & Python Data Load

A specification for iteration padding in filenames for ``fileBased`` series is introduced.
Padding present in read iterations is detected and conserved in processing.
Python builds have been simplified and python data loads now work for both meshes and particles.

Changes to "0.3.0-alpha"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Features
""""""""

- CMake:

  - add ``openPMD::openPMD`` alias for full-source inclusion #277
  - include internally shipped pybind11 v2.2.3 #281
  - ADIOS1: enable serial API usage even if MPI is present #252 #254
- introduce detection and specification ``%0\d+T`` of iteration padding #270
- Python:

  - add unit tests #249
  - expose record components for particles #284

Bug Fixes
"""""""""

- improved handling of ``fileBased`` Series and ``READ_WRITE`` access
- expose ``Container`` constructor as ``protected`` rather than ``public`` #282
- Python:

  - return actual data in ``load_chunk`` #286

- docs:

  - improve "Install from source" section #274 #285
  - Spack python 3 install command #278

ADIOS1 Build Fixes & Less Flushes

We fixed build issues with the ADIOS1 backend.
The number of performed flushes in backends was generally minimized.

Changes to "0.1.0-alpha"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bug Fixes
"""""""""

- SerialIOTest: ``loadChunk`` template missing for ADIOS1 #227
- prepare running serial applications linked against parallel ADIOS1 library #228

- minimize number of flushes in backend #212


0.1.0-alpha
-----------
**Date:** 2018-06-06

This is the first developer release of openPMD-api.

Both HDF5 and ADIOS1 are implemented as backends with serial and parallel I/O support.
The C++11 API is considered alpha state with few changes expected to come.
We also ship an unstable preview of the Python3 API.
